# How to save a princess

I regularly talk about Single Level of Abstraction `SLA` with colleges. This example gives a few examples where SLA can or *should*  be used.

## Why Single Level of Abstraction

- Code readability is much better
  - Fewer LoC per function
  - Less Comments needed (function names replace them)
- Less mental jumping between Levels (but now functions)
- Write Code top down
- Encapsulation
- Reusability of functions (e.g. -> Defeat() function)

## How to use the code

The `YoungHero` class will show code which has some `SLA` issues and contains some comments what to refactor.
The `SeasonedHero` shows a refactored version.
